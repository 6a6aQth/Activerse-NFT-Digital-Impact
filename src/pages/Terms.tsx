            ActiVerse is a web-based platform that enables users to discover real-world events aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to claim non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by scanning QR codes at eligible events. NFTs are issued via smart contracts and serve as digital badges representing real-life impact.
